# Semantic-Website-Challenge-1
 

## Description ##
I added alt tags to make images accessible in CSS. I made it so that the SEO option in the header links to where it is supposed to lead. I added semantic html elemnts like header, article, section, aside, footer. I made a precise, descriptive title in the title element. I made comments on CSS styling. I created a README.md for the project. I moved CSS selectors and properties to organize semantic structure.
